# Hi, I’m Kuba 👋

I’m an **embedded Linux & C developer** learning and building my way toward **end-to-end Linux stacks**: from **board bring-up** and **drivers** to **user-space services** and integration.

Right now, I’m focused on:
- ⚙️ Exploring **board bring-up** (U-Boot, Device Tree, kernel boot).
- 🔭 Learning and writing **drivers** for sensors, displays, and peripherals.
- 📦 Creating **reproducible Buildroot/Yocto images**.
- 🖥️ Building simple **user-space apps** (C, LVGL, communication stacks).
- 🔒 Practicing **integration skills**: performance, security, OTA updates.

### 🌱 Current Journey
I’m working on small demos like:
- 📚 An STM32MP1 **eBook reader** (display + LVGL + PDF rendering).
- 📞 An STM32MP2 **VoIP softphone** (audio + networking + SIP).

These are learning projects, but also stepping stones toward **production-grade Linux solutions**.

### 🛠️ What you’ll find here
- **Learning repos** → experiments, drivers, kernel modules, and C libraries.
- **Tools & utilities** → scripts and helpers for Linux development.
- **Demo projects** → end-to-end examples I’m polishing into case studies.
